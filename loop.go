//Sr. No.	Loop Type	Description
//1.	While Loop	In while loop, a condition is evaluated before processing a body of the loop. If a condition is true then and only then the body of a loop is executed.
//2.	Do-While Loop	In a doâ€¦while loop, the condition is always executed after the body of a loop. It is also called an exit-controlled loop.
//3.	For Loop	In a for loop, the initial value is performed only once, then the condition tests and compares the counter to a fixed value after each iteration, stopping the for loop when false is returned.
